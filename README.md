Link: Spatial-Temporal Neural Network for P300 Detection with Applications Using EEG-Based BCIs.
# Installation
Spatial-Temporal Neural Network for P300 Detection, written in Pytorch.
This is a novel DL-based model for P300 detection, providing a validated biological EEG signal processing technology. 
We encourage to use of this model in various EEG processing tasks.

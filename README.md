# STNN-for-P300-detection
Link: Spatial-Temporal Neural Network for P300 Detection with Applications Using EEG-Based BCIs.
# Introduction
* Spatial-Temporal Neural Network for P300 Detection, written in Pytorch.  
* This is a novel DL-based model for P300 detection, providing a validated biological EEG signal processing technology.  
* We encourage to use of this model in various EEG processing tasks.
# Requirements
* Python  
* Pytorch  
* scipy
* collections
* numpy
* random
# Materials
* [BCI Competition III-dataset II] (http://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/)
# Run on the device
* run demo.ipynb
* Trust me, after 1-5 mins, you will reach an accuracy greater than more than 90%.
